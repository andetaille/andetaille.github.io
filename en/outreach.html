			<!-- TFJM -->
			<hr>
			<p>Since 2023, I am involved in the <a href="https://tfjm.org/" class="event-link"><math><msup><mi>𝕋𝔽𝕁𝕄</mi><mi>𝟚</mi></msup></math></a>, as a jury member and volunteer.</p>
			<p>The <abbr title="French Tournament of Young Mathematicians in French"><math><msup><mi>𝕋𝔽𝕁𝕄</mi><mi>𝟚</mi></msup></math></abbr> is a mathematics tournament for high school students, whose objective is to offer them an insight of what mathematical research looks like, by making them work as a team on a set of problems with open formulation, and to debate on these problems with the other teams in front of a jury of researchers.</p>

			<!-- ETEAM -->
			<hr>
			<p>In 2024, I was lucky to participate in the first edition of the <a href="https://eteam.tfjm.org/" class="event-link">ETEAM</a> tournament, as a jury member and volunteer.</p>
			<p>The <abbr title="European Tournament of Enthusiastic Apprentice Mathematicians">ETEAM</abbr> is an international version of the <math><msup><mi>𝕋𝔽𝕁𝕄</mi><mi>𝟚</mi></msup></math> presented above.
			The first edition was held in Luxemburg in 2024, and the objective is that this tournament grows in the upcoming years, and that more and more countries have the opportunity to participate.</p>

			<!-- MMI -->
			<hr>
			<p>Since the beginning of my PhD, I participate from time to time to the activities of the <a href="https://mmi-lyon.fr/" class="event-link">MMI</a> as a volunteer.</p>
			<p>The <abbr title="House of Mathematics and Computer sciences in French">MMI</abbr> is a mediation center for mathematics and computer sciences founded by the <abbr title="Excellence Laboratory in Mathematics and Computer sciences of Lyon">LABEX MILYON</abbr>, that offers activities to discover concepts of mathematics and computer sciences in a simple, playful, and relaxed way, intended for students, teachers, and large audience.</p>

			<!-- Discrete maths club -->
			<hr>
			<p>During my PhD, I participate from time to time in the <a href="https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~lass/club.html" class="event-link">Discrete Mathematics Club of Lyon</a>.</p>
			<p>The Discrete Mathematics Club organizes sessions on Sunday, or during the week in school holidays periods, to offer challenges to students enthusiast of mathematical problems, and to give them statements and tools to go further.</p>
			<p>Such clubs exist in many other cities, for instance in <a href="http://club.i2m.univ-amu.fr/accueil/" class="event-link">Marseille</a>.
			Do not hesitate to inform yourselves about those that may exist close to you!</p>

			<!-- ComSciCon -->
			<hr>
			<p>In 2024, I participated in the fifth edition of <a href="https://france.comscicon.com/" class="event-link">ComSciCon France</a>.</p>
			<p>ComSciCon France is a three days workshop about scientific communication for French-speaking PhD students.
			The goal is to train PhD students to scientific communication, <i>via</i> practical activities and meetings with working professionnals.

			<!-- Maths en Jeans -->
			<hr>
			<p>In 2024, I participated in the <a href="https://www.mathenjeans.fr/" class="event-link">Maths en Jeans</a> convention in Lyon, by helping with logistics, by participating in the students-researchers meeting, and by chairing a presentations session.</p>
			<p>The Maths en Jeans method is the opportunity to initiate high school students to research, by making them work on original problems under the supervision of their teacher and a researcher.
			The students may then present their results to the other teams during the annual convention.</p>
			<p>If you are Belgian like me, please note that such an action also exists in <a href="https://www.mathenjeans.be/" class="event-link">Belgium</a>!</p>

                        <!-- Math à Lyon -->
                        <hr>
			<p>In 2024, I animated a <a href="https://mmi-lyon.fr/?site_atelier=mathalyon" class="event-link">MathαLyon</a> workshop.</p>
			<p>MathαLyon is a travelling exhibition of mathematics, that goes from high school to high school, to allow students to discover mathematics <i>via</i> a series of playful workshops, animated by researchers.</p>

			<!-- BARCamp -->
			<hr>
			<p>In December 2023, I had the opportunity to present my PhD topic at the <a href="https://portaildoc.univ-lyon1.fr/culture/barcamp" class="event-link">BARCamp</a> of the university library of Lyon 1.</p>
			<p>The <abbr title="Welcome To Research Camp in French">BARCamp</abbr> is an action of the university library of Lyon 1, allowing PhD students to explain their PhD topic to a large audience public in about ten minutes.</p>
			<p>If you watch my <a href="https://portaildoc.univ-lyon1.fr/culture/barcamp/barcamp-antoine-detaille" class="event-link">talk</a>, do not forget to watch the excellent <a href="https://portaildoc.univ-lyon1.fr/culture/barcamp/barcamp-luca-francone" class="event-link">presentation</a> of Luca Francone, with which we animated this workshop!</p>

			<!-- Midi des mathématiques -->
			<hr>
			<p>In February 2023, I had the pleasure to come back to UCLouvain, where I studied, to give a talk during the <a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/sc/math/actualites/les-midis-des-mathematiques-0.html" class="event-link">midis des Mathématiques</a>.</p>
			<p>The <i>midis des Mathématiques</i> are an action from the school of mathematics of UCLouvain to present research themes in mathematics in a simplified way for students.</p>
			<p>You will find the slides of my talk here.<br>
