					This workshop aims at gathering young researchers working on bubbling analysis in the broad sense.
					The objective is to share problems and techniques related to this topic, fostering new collaborations.
					To this aim, talks will be offered featuring various aspects and applications of bubbling in different fields of geometric analysis, to emphasize the usefulness and ubiquity of this concept and allow the exchange of ideas between members of various communities in geometric analysis.<br>

					This workshop is intended as a convivial event between young researchers sharing common mathematical interests, and a special emphasis will be put on the pedagogy of the lectures that will be given, that should be accessible to non-experts and with the amount of prerequisites kept to a minimum.

				Practical information

			<h3>
				Venue
			</h3>
			<p>
				The whole workshop will take place in the main building (HG) of the ETH Zürich.
				The address is Rämistrasse 101.
				To come by public transportation, either take the tram to ETH/Universitätspital, and you will then be facing the main entrance (with a dome on top), 
				or from Central/Zürich HB, you can come by foot, and will arrive at the back entrance, facing the Polyterrasse (with the statues).
			</p>
			<p>
				To decypher the room numbers in the above schedule, note that the first two letters (HG) refer to the building, and the letter in the middle refers to the floor.
				The ground floor is labeled E (for Erdgeschoss), and then it follows the alphabetical order (except that, for some reason, there is no floor I, even though there is a floor J!).
				In other words, the first talk is on the first floor, the ones in the afternoon on the ground floor, and the lunch is underground.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first talk will take place in the Audi Max room (HG F 30).
				The room is at the first floor, you will be facing it after turning left when leaving the stairs that are on the right when coming from the main entrance, just after the fountain.
				From the back entrance, take the stairs on your left, then turn left at the first floor and cross the building straight ahead to be facing the room.
				(Mind that in both cases, there is a half-floor midway between the ground floor (E) and the first floor (F).)
				We will be there around half an hour before to welcome you there.
